            There are a few ways in which you can think about things. Here are two of them
        </p>

            Many people (myself included) grew up thinking that the first kind of thinking was the "serious, good" thinking we would do once we were scientists.
        <br/>
        <br/>
         The second kind of thinking, if we ever did it, was kind of like daydreaming. 
        <br/>
            <br/>
        I call the second kind of thinking ‘questing’. And, now, I think it’s really helpful to spend part of your time questing if you want to learn new stuff and come up with new ideas.
        <br/>
            <br/>
        So, below, I’ll try to give a quick guide to thinking in this style.
        <br/>
            <br/>
        There are few problems, which I’ll address upfront.
        <br/>
            <br/>
        Problem #1 - you need to know some stuff to quest. If you don’t have any stuff in your head to quest with, it probably won’t work.
        <br/>
            <br/>
        Problem #2 - it’s really really really hard to teach questing because it happens all in your mind, so it’s hard to know we’re experiencing the same thing 
*although - see appendix - many great thinkers have described things that sound similar to questing
*also quick caveat - do you know how you normally think? If, for example, you have aphantasia you might end up doing this differently than we do. A guide to thinking styles here. 
        <br/>
            <br/>
        OK, so let’s get started. 
        <br/>
            <br/>
        Elements of a good quest:

            Spell = how to change one thing into another, or how to link two things
            <br>
            <br>
            AKA an equation (although people often think that means something different than what we’re saying here)
            <br>
            <br>
            Most people think equation =

       YES AND NO. Your mind making a picture/relation thing that gives meaning to those letters is what makes it powerful! Just those letters don’t mean a thing. Imagine scratching those letters in sand. Would they mean anything to a passing chimpanzee? Nope! The stuff in our head that has a bunch of context for what ‘E’ etc is is what gives it meaning. 
        <br>
            <br>
            So, once you understand an equation, it might look more complex in your head.
            <br>
            <br>
            That’s where most people feel like things might stop in school. But if you’re questing, you’ve only just begun. So, now you kind of know what you can put into parts of this equation, but what does that mean?
<br>
            <br>
           Here’s an example of what you might do if you were on a quest with E = mc^2
